Gojack is a simple library for running blackjack games.

Typical usage:
// Start new game with one deck (shuffled in initialization)
game := gojack.NewGame(1)
// Add the non-dealer players
game.AddPlayer("player1")
game.AddPlayer("player2")
// Deal two cards to everyone
game.InitialDeal()
// Play until the game ends
for !(game.IsEnd()) {
    // if the player wants to take a hit
    game.Deal(game.CurrentPlayer())
    // call at the end of each move
    game.IncrementMove()
}
// Print the state of the current game
fmt.Println(game)

Gojack also supports loading JSON-encoded input files:
game := LoadGame(filename)
